        <p>
            I’m a passionate and experienced private <strong>livery designer</strong> in <strong>ERLC, Roblox</strong>. I focus exclusively on listed servers, which means <strong>I don’t create liveries privately through gamepasses</strong>. I accept <strong>⏣ Robux payment only</strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I specialize in creating clean, professional, and immersive liveries that bring realism and identity to your roleplay departments. My goal is to ensure each design not only looks visually striking but also fits seamlessly into the roleplay environment, enhancing the overall experience for both players and the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I offer high-quality, reliable, and affordable design services tailored to the unique needs of your department. Whether it’s replicating real-life emergency vehicle designs or crafting custom liveries with a distinctive identity, I take pride in delivering attention-to-detail, creativity, and professionalism in every project. 
            <strong>Thank you for taking the time to read about my work—I truly appreciate your interest!</strong>
